        McBurnie Coachcraft was founded in the United States by Tom McBurnie to
        build replicas of Ferraris like the 250 GTO and the Daytona. Cars built
        by McBurnie featured in TV series like “Miami Vice” and “Baywatch,” as
        well as feature films like “The Italian Job,” “Ford v Ferrari,” and
        “Overdrive.” Using replicas in films is typically far less expensive,
        and easier to insure. The 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO you see here is actually
        a Datsun 280Z with a new fiberglass body, it has a few other changes too
        like new wheels and a Ferrari valve cover on the inline-six. This car
        has appeared in a number of major feature films as well as a Gucci photo
        shoot, it comes with movie scripts and storyboards, as well as movie
        documentation to prove its identity.
